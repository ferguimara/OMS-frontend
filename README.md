# OMS Platform

I have decided to spend a few weeks here working on a basic OMS (order management system) platform that has several features. I started off with simply making a react application where users can create orders. I then added authentication to give a more real experience of what an e-commerce platform could look like.

## Future Enhancements
- Enhance my Firebase to include user types so you can have buyers and sellers
- Enhance what orders look like
- For buyers, add a cart option
- Clean up code
- Fix Admin Page
- Only see orders for that user
